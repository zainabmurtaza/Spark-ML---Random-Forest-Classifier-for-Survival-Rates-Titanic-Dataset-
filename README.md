# Spark-ML---Random-Forest-Classifier-for-Survival-Rates-Titanic-Dataset-
Spark ML: In this assignment, I have tackled missing values with Data Imputation, indexed categorical features by encoding values, used the imputed and encoded values to form a feature vector for training and testing data using randomSplit(). Accordingly, used Random Forest Classifier; It is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Used the area under ROC and area under Precision-Recall curves in a Binary Classification Evaluator class for model evaluation.
